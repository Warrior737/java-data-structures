1. Creation Design Patterns in Java

they focus on the process of creating objects, they aim to enhance flexibility and efficiency in object creation,
allowing systems to remain independent of how their objects are constructed, compose and represent.


- Singleton Design Pattern
It guarantees that a class has just one instance and offers ways to access it globally.


- Builder Design pattern
helps building a complex object step by step and the final result return the object
        Employee.Builder emplBuilder = new Employee.Builder();

The @Builder annotation can be used to automatically generate a builder for our class


- Factory Method:
Defines an Interface for creating an object but it lets subclasses decide the class they want to instantiate
