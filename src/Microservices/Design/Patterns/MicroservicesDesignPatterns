1️⃣ Decomposition Patterns

🧩 Decompose by Business Capability
Split services based on domain responsibilities (e.g., Order, Payment, Inventory).

🪟 Decompose by Subdomain
Follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to isolate bounded contexts.

2️⃣ Integration Patterns

🔗 API Gateway Pattern
A single entry point for client requests; handles routing, auth, rate limiting.

💬 Messaging Pattern
Use asynchronous messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupled communication.

3️⃣ Database Patterns

🗃️ Database per Service
Each microservice has its own database — ensures isolation and autonomy.

🔀 Saga Pattern
Manage distributed transactions via a series of local transactions and events.


4️⃣ Reliability Patterns

🔁 Circuit Breaker
Prevent cascading failures by breaking the call if a service is down.

🛡️ Bulkhead
Isolate resources per service to avoid total system crash.

⏳ Timeouts & Retries
Set proper retry policies to avoid waiting endlessly for failed services.


5️⃣ Observability Patterns

📊 Centralized Logging
Use tools like ELK Stack, Graylog for tracking logs.

📈 Distributed Tracing
Visualize call flows using OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, or Zipkin.

📡 Health Checks
Enable proactive monitoring and auto-recovery.

6️⃣ Security Patterns

🛂 Access Token (JWT)
Stateless authentication across services.

🔐 API Gateway Auth
Centralized auth & SSL termination.mae
