Java

Top Features of Java:
- Platform Independent
- Object-Oriented
- High performance
- Multithreaded


JDK -> Java Development Kit: - Includes everything needed to develop, compile amd run java programs, its essentially a superset of JRE

JRE -> Java Runtime Environment: - its the software environment to run java apps,Includes JVM and  core libraries and other components

JVM -> Java Virtual Machine: - this is the core engine within the JRE that executes java byteCode, enabling the write-once run everywhere.
                CORE FEATURES OF JVM
         - Bytecode Execution
         - Memory Management
                STRUCTURE
                    - Heap Area:  Where objects and arrays are stored
                        -> Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);      // Scanner object is stored in the heap, sc its stored in the stack!
                    - Method Area: stores class-level information such as class Structures, method bytecode, static variables, constant pools and Interfaces.
                    - JVM Stacks: store method execution data, including local variables, method arguments, it can be fixed or dynamic
         - Garbage Collector
                - Finds objects in the java program and automatically removes them to free up memory.



Java String Pool ?

it's a place in the heap memory where all strings are defined in the program!


Data Types:
- Primitive: ( Boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, double ).
- NON-Primitive: (String, Arrays, Class, Object, Interface )

Class Variable: static variable, its define in the class but outside of any method constructor or block
Dot Operator: Access the instance variables and methods of class objects

Access Modifiers: Public, Private, Protected, Default
