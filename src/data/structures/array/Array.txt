Arrays in Java

Arrays allow us to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable.
For Primitive arrays elements are stored in a contiguous memory location, Non-Primitive Arrays use references

Types>
1. Single Dimension Array
2. Multi-dimensional Array

Key Features

- Efficient Access: Accessing an element by its index its fast and has constant time complexity of 0(1)
- Memory Management: Arrays have fixed size, which makes memory management predictable and Straight forward
-

Disadvantages

- Fixed Size: Once and Array is created, its size cannot be changed, which can lead to memory waste if the size its overestimate or insufficient
- Insertion and Deletion: Inserting or deleting elements specially in the middle of the array can be costly as it may require to shift elements


Array Declaration    ------>      type[] arrayName;
Create an Array      ------>      int[] numbers = new int[5];
Object Array         ------>      object[] = new object[];


Common Mistakes to avoid:

- Accessing  Out-of-Bounds Index:  Maybe trying to access a negative or a higher index would provoke ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- Assuming Array Size could change
- If Array It's not Initialize java would assign default values:
    Numeric = 0
    Boolean = False
    Object = Null
